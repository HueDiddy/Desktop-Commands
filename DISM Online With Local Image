Fix Windows 10 recovery image:

First mount new recovery image

To run Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool with an alternate source (install.wim) image, use these steps:

Open Start.
Search for Command Prompt, right-click the top result, and select the Run as administrator option.
Type the following command to repair the Windows 10 image and press Enter: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:G:\Sources\install.wim
In the command, replace "G" with the ISO mount point drive letter in File Explorer.

(Optional) Type the following command to limit the use of Windows Update and press Enter: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:G\Sources\install.wim /LimitAccess

(Optional) Type the following variant of the previous command to accomplish the same task and press Enter: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:G:\Sources\install.wim:1 /LimitAccess
In the command, change "G:\Sources," for the path to the "install.wim" file.

Once you complete the steps, the command will scan and repair the problems using the "install.wim" file you specified as the alternative source.
